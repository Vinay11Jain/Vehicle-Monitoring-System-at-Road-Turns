# Vehicle-Monitoring-System-at-Road-Turns
intend to make a monitoring system for vehicles at turning points on roads to 
ensure that accidents do not happen and also to save time in case when no vehicles are ahead, by giving information 
to a vehicle that there are no vehicles ahead and speed need not be reduced.

The aim of our project is to efficiently monitor the vehicleâ€™s movement near road turns to prevent accidents and also to save 
time if no vehicles are coming towards us, by getting information about the same.
The following are objectives that will help us achieve our aim:
1. To design a Vehicle Detecting Unit capable of locating vehicles in the vicinity of the road turns along with their 
velocities.
2. To design a Central Unit which uses the location and velocity information given by the Vehicle Detecting Unit 
along with the map of the road near the turn, to create different sets of information to be given to the vehicles near 
turns.
3. To design a Signal Processing Unit that uses the information given by the Central Unit to generate encrypted signals 
corresponding to each direction and send them to the vehicles.
4. To design a Signal Receiver Unit that receives relevant signals sent by the Signal Processing Unit. It has to be 
installed in vehicles.
